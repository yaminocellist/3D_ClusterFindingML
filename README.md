# 3D_ClusterFindingML

A Machine Learning project focused on identifying and reconstructing 3D clusters within the **sPHENIX TPC** detector using real data. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional reconstruction and modern deep learning by creating a manually labeled Ground Truth dataset.

## 🔬 Dataset Properties & Geometry (Sanity Checks)
Through empirical analysis of the `ntp_hit` ROOT tree, the following sPHENIX detector properties have been established for the Machine Learning pipeline:

### 1. Detector Subsystem Mapping
The dataset contains hits from multiple sub-detectors. They are mapped by `layer`:
*   **MVTX (Inner Silicon Pixels):** Layers 0, 1, 2
*   **INTT (Silicon Strips):** Layers 3, 4, 5, 6
*   **TPC (Gas Drift Volume):** Layers 7 through 54
*   **TPOT (Micromegas):** Layers 55, 56

### 2. TPC Coordinate Relationships
For the **TPC (Layers 7-54)**, the empirical formulas used to generate the spatial coordinates are:
*   **Radius (`r`):** Strictly fixed per layer (Standard Deviation = 0.0 cm). The `layer` integer acts as a perfect 1:1 lookup for the physical radius.
*   **X & Y:** Calculated from the continuous physical radius `r` (not the discrete `layer` index).
    *   `x = r * cos(phi)`
    *   `y = r * sin(phi)`
*   **Z:** Calculated linearly from drift time (`tbin`), dependent on the `zelem` branch (which indicates the side of the central membrane):
    *   If `zelem == 0`: `z = 0.42341 * tbin + 0.28000`
    *   If `zelem == 1`: `z = -0.42341 * tbin + 102.60500`

### 3. Bulletproof Data Cleaning Cuts
To isolate pure, physical TPC hits for ML training, the following cuts must be applied sequentially to the `ntp_hit` DataFrame:
1.  `layer >= 7 & layer <= 54`: Isolates the TPC.
2.  `hitID > 0`: Removes background/noise hits.
3.  `adc > 0`: Removes zero-energy ghost hits/artifacts.
4.  `dropna()`: Removes NaNs (which mostly populate the outer TPOT layers).
5.  `zelem.isin([0, 1])`: Enforces valid TPC geometry bounds.

## 🚀 ML Training Pipeline
The project follows a three-stage strategy to ensure robust cluster identification:

1.  **Numerical Classification:** Utilize traditional ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, or MLP) on numerical hit data to perform initial categorization and feature importance analysis.
2.  **Geometric Deep Learning:** Implement Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to exploit the spatial and topological relationships of hits, predicting clusters and track segments directly from the hit-graph.
3.  **Ensemble & Validation:** Merge and cross-verify results from both the numerical and GNN models to improve purity and efficiency, using the manually labeled Ground Truth for final performance metrics.

## 💻 Environment Setup

### Mac (Apple Silicon M-series)
1.  **Xcode Command Line Tools:** `xcode-select --install`
2.  **Homebrew:** Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if not already present.
3.  **ROOT CERN:** `brew install root`
4.  **Python Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n cluster_ml python=3.10
    conda activate cluster_ml
    pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn torch torch-geometric
    ```

### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu)
1.  **System Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev cmake g++ gcc binutils libx11-dev libxpm-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev python3 libssl-dev
    ```
2.  **ROOT CERN:** It is recommended to install ROOT via `conda` for easiest dependency management in WSL:
